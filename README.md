# hello-world
My very first repository
My name is Aaron Leon, and I am learning how to code one step at a time. I realize it will be a challenging journey, but no journey in life is an easy journey. As such, I want to commit to this journey and would love to hopefully further understand what it means to write code and maybe (and hopefully) make a career out of it!

Now, three months later, getting back to this to make an effort to be more consistent with myself and learn more, need to grow up.
